## Idea

This repository contains the best of my middle and high school projects. I've made a lot of them throughout the years and many have been lost or thrown away. But these ones were so fun to make and so fun to use or play with that I had to keep them. Go and explore! I hope they still work...

Note that I haven't changed any line of code since I've finished them years ago. So please, be understanding.
